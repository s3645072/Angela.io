## ITman                        Melbourne, Australia
Data Scientist Intern

Data Science Department  	Nov 2018 – Jan 2019

### Responsibilities 
Worked on bank dataset to classify new instance. This project finished individually, choosing a topic and then applying knowledge relate to machine learning to get good performance for classifier. 

•	Choosing topic, and search for relate dataset (bank data come from UCI)
•	Understanding data details, and got idea that should be done for project
•	Data cleaning and exploration with statistic information (sklearn package)
•	Data Visualisation on each feature on both population and different target class
•	Modelling with classification algorithms, include K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Random Forest
•	Evaluating models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve and AUC area

### Achievement
A good performance with Logistic Regression on bank dataset, especially for balanced dataset. The model could do good job on new instance to see whether customer would like to subscribe a team deposit or not.
